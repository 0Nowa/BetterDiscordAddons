# ServerFolders - [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Plugins/ServerFolders/ServerFolders.plugin.js)

Adds the option to create pseudo folders to organize your server icons.

- Right click a server and choose "Create Folder" to create a folder one spot before the server.
- Click a folder to toogle all server icons beneath the folder up to the next folder/end. (All servers beneath a folder up to the next folder are automaticly "inside" that folder)
- Right click a folder and either delete it or choose "Folder Settings" to change the color or access a name to the Folder.

DISCLAIMER: Moving servers within the boundaries folders is fine, so is moving a server down the serverlist into another folder. Trying to move a server up into another folder will result in folder icons to move in a wonky way upwards. So try to avoid that. It can't be changed.
