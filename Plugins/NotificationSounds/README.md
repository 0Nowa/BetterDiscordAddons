# Notification Sounds - [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Plugins/NotificationSounds/NotificationSounds.plugin.js)

Plays a song when you get a direct message or are mentioned in a server.
You can choose a song for either in the settings menu. "None" will mute the notifications.
You can add your own songs:
- open the plugin file
- right at the top is a list with the default songs
- to add a song 
  - choose a name (not a name that already exists) and place it in ""-brackets next to "name":
  - get the direct(!!) url of the song and place it in ""-brackets next to "url":
  
 Please do not ask me how to get direct urls from certain websites... Google is your friend
